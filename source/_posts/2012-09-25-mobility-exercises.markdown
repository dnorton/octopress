Like a lot of runners, I have dealt with some nagging injuries. In particular, I battle plantar fasciitis and [posterior tibial tendonitis](http://www.sportsmd.com/sportsmd_articles/id/319.aspx). I have tried a number of options to deal with this pain including [ART](http://www.activerelease.com), physical therapy, yoga, and single-leg balancing exercises (my balance is now excellent.) They all help, but nothing has made a significant change.

Then I discovered this video on [Coach Jay Johnson's blog](http://www.coachjayjohnson.com/2012/08/phil-wharton-foot-and-ankle-routine/). I've started doing the routine on a regular basis, and it has made a major difference.
