I am quite forgetful. _(My wife will gladly back me on that statement.)_  

My #2 rule of "Things Daniel Should Always Do" is:  

If I really want to remember something, **I should write it down.**

This is especially true in the complex world of software development where on any given day I'm juggling between two or three different programming languages, SCM tools, databases, IDEs (because for some reason not everyone uses IntelliJ... weird, I know.) I'm reviewing SQL scripts, approving pull requests, debugging running systems.  And I might need to run a whole assortment of unix commands to keep everything humming along. 

Thankfully, we live in a world with an almost limitless supply of tools for the memory deficient like me.

### Google Keep

[Google Keep][1] is a relatively new offering from Google, but it is quite handy for short lists and notes. I tend to keep a daily task list of my top priorities that I create during our daily stand up. It helps me stay on task.

### Evernote

[Evernote][2] is the "[Grand Pooba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Poobah)" of note taking apps. It can record almost anything. Because of the overwhelming options, it's a good idea to define and stick to a strategy. There are [millions of results for "how I use evernote"](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+I+use+evernote&oq=how+I+use+evernote&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3j69i65l2.2577j0j7&sourceid=chrome&espv=210&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8&safe=active) including [this lifehacker.com article.](http://lifehacker.com/5989980/ive-been-using-evernote-all-wrong-heres-why-its-actually-amazing) If you want a full run down of all the cool stuff it can do, go there first.  I'm just giving a brief summary of how I use it.

First if you use Google Chrome, install [Evernote Web Clipper.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/evernote-web-clipper/pioclpoplcdbaefihamjohnefbikjilc) You'll thank me later.  You can use it to grab screen shots or whole articles of any web page. I always screen grab order confirmation pages and keep them in a "receipts" notebook.

Second, take advantage of the Evernote Android app to scan business cards. I created a notebook called "contacts" that is just a collection of scanned business cards. The text parsing feature of Evernote makes this worthwhile, but I do suggest adding your own meta data to the card.

Third, although I don't suggest actually storing passwords in Evernote, it's very useful for keeping some account information especially because the OSX and Windows desktop clients let you encrypt/hide text. _note: I don't use a password manager although I really should._
