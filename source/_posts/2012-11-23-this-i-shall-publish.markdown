I just want to mention that I have worked on several posts recently that I decided for one reason or another not to publish. 

I have a post about my thoughts on Hurricane Sandy, but I decided it's just a little too personal to publish

I have a post about why I blog, but I feel like it's a topic that's been played to death.  I blog because I feel like it.  I blog when I want and about what I want, and there really isn't a strong rhyme or reason.

I have a blog post about the Ohio State half time band video, but that's really more appropriate for Google+.

But I will publish this post to at least prove that I'm still alive. Hope everyone had a nice Thanksgiving.
