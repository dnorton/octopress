## _why blog?_

I was talking to a co-worker recently, and he said that he would never blog because he doesn't have any big ideas that other people would want to read. He's a senior architect who almost single-handedly designed the current iteration of our application. So, I personally think he has plenty of valuable ideas that I would be delighted to read.

He did cause me a moment of reflection though. Why am I choosing to contribute to a blog? I certainly don't have a unique niche.
