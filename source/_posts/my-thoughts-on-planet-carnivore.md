The Kindle short, "Planet Carnivore" by Alex Renton, is an in-depth look at and indictment of the industrialized 
meat industry. The main arguments from the Introduction are:

1. Our current system is a huge problem.
<blockquote>
During my lifetime the world's population has doubled. But it has increased its meat consumption by four times - to the
point whe meat production, in the summary of one eminent UN panel's recent report, is 'as damaging as fossil fuels.'
</blockquote>

2. There are practical solutions.
<blockquote>
We don't have to stop eating meat. We do need to do it less, and farm it better.
</blockquote>
