I am a huge fan of the MOOC (Massive Online Open Course) movement and [Coursera][1] in particular. I have signed up for several course this year:

* [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://class.coursera.org/progfun-002/class)
* [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 (Stanford University)](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo)
* [Algorithms, Part I (Princeton University)](https://class.coursera.org/algs4partI-003/class)
* [Bioinformatics Algorithms (Part 1) (University of California San Diego)](https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics)

I have completed exactly **NONE** of these courses, and that's a problem. Because they are free and very thorough, and the penalty for not completing the class so low, I haven't made the effort needed to invest fully in any of the classes. I always let life and work priorities supercede time I should be spending catching up on discrete mathematics or working on programming assignments.

I do think that taking the classes even if I don't finish is a positive thing. I am constantly learning skills 
and gaining knowledge that have a direct bearing on my career. 
But I'm not getting the full benefit that I would receive by fully participating and completing the class.

So, I'm going to take some steps to change that. Perhaps it means involving myself in an online study group. Or I could take some initiative and organize a local in-person study here in Charlotte.

_If you are interested in taking a Coursera course and feel the same disappointment with never completing a class, reach out to me. I'm going to start an informal group._
