I'm not a fan of running during the summer, so I tend to have training cycles that fluctuate over the year. During late spring, I transition from mostly running to triathlon training because cycling in 95 degree weather is far more tolerable than running in it. Plus, I can do lots of cross-training and swimming indoors. I like to end my triathlon season with a fall triathlon. 

I begin to run in earnest again in the early fall and usually plan a late fall race -- it's been the NYC Marathon for the last 3 years. But I live in Charlotte now, so my guaranteed NYC entry is over.  Because I have been battling some ankle soreness and mild plantar fasciitis (PF), I decided to limit my mileage to a half marathon this year so I don't re-aggravate it.

Then if all goes well and the injury fairy stays away, I'll bump up my mileage over the winter -- the best running season in North Carolina -- and attempt a fast, flat spring marathon. So, here is my schedule:

1. [Rev3 Olympic Tri - Anderson, SC](http://rev3tri.com/anderson/anderson-news/) - October 14, 2012
2. [Thunder Road Half Marathon - Charlotte, NC](http://www.runcharlotte.com/) - November 17, 2012
3. [Myrtle Beach Marathon - Myrtle Beach, SC](http://www.mbmarathon.com/events/marathonfc22.htm) - February 16, 2013

If you're going to be at any of these races, let me know. I would love to meet up for a pre-race beer (or post-race... doesn't matter.)
