Hi, I'm Daniel Norton. I'm a software developer, a runner who dabbles in triathlons and [HIIT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training), a husband who is comically inept at home repair but can disassemble and reassemble a bike or a computer. You are likely to find me tweeting or posting on Google+.
